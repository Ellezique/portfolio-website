                        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                        <p>I am a current student undertaking a full-stack web-development bootcamp, seeking to gain industry experience following course completion in August 2021.</p> 
                        <p>I currently yield the powers of: HTML, CSS, Git, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, APIs and React. I plan on expanding my skills to include: MongoDB, Node.js, Mongoose, Express.js and Redux.</p>
                        <p>I am a creative personality with a passion for the arts. I enjoy consuming movies, series, theatre and books. I am a gamer, playing for fun, with a preference for PC and arcade games. Occasionally, you may find me drawing dark matter or painting with acrylics or watercolor.
                            I love learning. My browser history is littered with academic papers and research.
                        </p>
                        <p>Prior to my pursuit of a STEM career, I worked as a practicing lawyer with several years of experience in criminal and civil law.</p>
                        <p>This website is built using HTML and CSS. You may read about my other projects below.</p>

                        <h2><a id="project-post-3"></a>ARCADE SECRETARY - Teamwork Hackathon</h2>
                        <h5>JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS</h5>
                        <p>Arcade Secretary is a score-based speed typing game. Secretaries are armed with their keyboards and lighting reflexes when they enter the fast-paced corporate battlefield where speed and accuracy pave the way to victory!</p>
                        <p>Secretaries are given a strict deadline during which they will be given words, which they must type and submit as quickly and as accurately as super-humanly possible.</p>
                        <p>Secretaries will be rewarded for accuracy and receive one point for each character that they typed correctly. Mistakes are a liability! If a secretary makes a mistake, they will not get a point for the incorrectly typed character.</p>
                        <p>Secretaries race against time! When time runs out, the last word will be discarded. The deadline is reached and the game ends.</p>
                        <p>Secretaries are then provided with a performance review which will include total score, WPM (words per minute) and average accuracy per character.</p>
                        <p>Secretaries are immortal and live to battle again, always seeking to improve and chase deadline victories.</p>

                        <h2><a id="project-post-1"></a>RIDDLES - Terminal Application</h2>
                        <h5>Ruby, Git, Github, Markdown</h5>
                        <p>Riddles runs from the shell and accepts user input. Players may enter their username or continue as default "Player One" (yes, this is a reference to arcade games and Ernest Cline's novel, "Ready Player One").</p>
                        <p>Riddles is a ruby terminal application game that challenges the user to solve 5 riddles. Each riddle has a one-word answer. When playing, the user will receive the riddle and have an opportunity to provide their one-word answer. If the user solves the riddle, or if they run out of attempts, they move to the next riddle until they have played all 5 riddles. If the user is unable to solve the riddle, they may attempt a set number of tries (how many will depend on the difficulty mode selected).</p>
                        <p>Aesthetics give the game some personality and visual appeal. Ascii art was copied from an online generator and pasted as a string in the code. The lolize gem was used to color the Ascii headers for each section of the application. The colorize gem introduced solid color text.</p>
