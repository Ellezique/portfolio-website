## FUNCTIONALITY/ FEATURES
###### Credit page
The credits page, as a seperate page, is neither essential nor strictly part of the portfolio and should not distract from the portfolio itself. Therefore, it does not link from the navbar but rather links from the footer. The purpose of the credit page is to:
- provide special thanks and credit to stock photographers, whose images have been used throughout the website, with a dedicated page that names each stock photographer and links to the external website where their images can be found;
- create a not-so-secret link to an aesthetic mood board image page to reward users for taking special interest in the photo credits;
- specifically assert copyright over the portrait image.
###### Navbar and burger menu
The desktop and tablet versions of the website have a fixed navbar that stays at the top of the screen regardless of the user scrolling down the page. When the page narrows, as it does with mobile version, the navbar changes to a drop down hamburger menu.
###### Responsive design
The layout of the pages changes with screen size ensuring that mobile, through tablet to desktop screen sizes have a responsive design. The font-size increases on small/mobile screens.
###### External links
The website contains external links to my Github and Linkedin profiles. The footer links to a not-so-secret credit page, where stock images link to where the stock photographers made their images available online. 
###### Contact form
 The contact form message textarea can be extended vertically by clicking and dragging the bottom right corner of the message box. My email does not link from the contact sidebar so as to encourage use of the contact form. The email does however open from the footer if the user has the relevant browser features enabled. A fake phone number is also linked in the footer.
###### PDF Link
The website contains a link to a mock-up pdf resume. The pdf document is converted from an image and is intentionally not saved as a text-searchable document. Provided user browser settings allow, the link will open the pdf in a new tab.
